# Outdoors - Tour Booking Application

Outdoors is a robust and scalable backend system for a modern tour booking platform. Built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, it provides secure RESTful APIs for managing tours, users, reviews, and bookings. The system features advanced filtering, sorting, pagination, and geospatial search to enhance tour discovery. Security is ensured through JWT authentication and role-based access control, while Nodemailer and SendGrid handle reliable email notifications. Automated background and recurring tasks are managed using both Agenda and cron jobs, making Outdoors a production-ready foundation for any travel or experience-based application.
